# ETL-Extract_Transform_Load

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Project

Description:

Contributed to the development and maintenance of an end-to-end ETL pipeline, facilitating the extraction, transformation, and loading of movie data from the Movie Database API into MySQL databases. Played a key role in leveraging Python for scripting and automation of the ETL process.

Key Responsibilities and Achievements:

Extracted movie data from the Movie Database API using the requests library, encompassing movie details and credits.
Applied comprehensive data transformation techniques to format extracted data appropriately for subsequent storage and analysis phases.
Contributed to the development of functions responsible for writing transformed data into CSV files and loading them into designated MySQL databases.
Implemented robust error handling mechanisms to ensure the reliability and resilience of the ETL pipeline under varying conditions.
Contributed to the design of MySQL database schemas tailored to accommodate raw data, mapped data, and consolidated data, optimizing data querying and analysis processes.
Collaborated in the creation of SQL queries aimed at aggregating and analyzing movie data based on diverse attributes, including release year and producer.
Conducted thorough testing and debugging procedures to validate data accuracy and integrity throughout the ETL process, ensuring high-quality output.
Documented the architecture of the ETL pipeline, including detailed data flow diagrams and comprehensive database schemas, to facilitate understanding and future maintenance.

Technologies Used:
Python, requests library, MySQL, CSV, datetime, os
